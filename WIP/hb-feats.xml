            <p>Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to mystically lend to your companions when you see them falter. You’re not sure how you do it; you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune’s favor!</p>
            <p class="indent">When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use this ability, you can’t use your Lucky racial trait before the end of your next turn.</p>

            <p>When angered, you can radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li>Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can’t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            </ul>
